Note the platform you used for development (Windows, OS X, ...): OS X



Provide instructions on how to compile and run your code, especially if you used a nonstandard Makefile. Leave it blank if it will just compile with latest XCode or Visual Studio 2015 Community.



If you did not meet all problem set requirements, let us know where your bugs are and what you did to try to eliminate the bugs. We want to give you as much partial credit as we can.



Provide some overview of the code design. Don't go into details; just give us the big picture.



Describe steps the TF should take to test and evaluate your code if your implementation strays from the assignment specification.
